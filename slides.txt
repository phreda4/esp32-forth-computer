goal

Build a complete computer with a esp32 microcontroller

Like a C64 or Jupiter Ace but with R3 Lang

Use FabGL library for devices
	generate VGA signal
	read keyboard
	read mouse
	play Sound


R3 Lang

A colorforth derived

Focus in simplify programer experience

-Remove compiler manipulation from code

	Clasic forth

	IMMEDIATE MODE
	HERE , - generate code
	CREATE DOES> - define behavior in compiler

	ColorForth

	HERE ,
	CYAN WORDS - Explicit inline

-Use prefix instead of color (really coloforth have prefix in the codification)

-Rethink control flow because this is made with control compiler mechanism

-No access to ASM

Questionable decision (but is a experiment!!)

-0 terminate string
-file instead blocks
-Not use floating point numbers
-Only a Framebuffer, no console
-Rigid interface with OS, easy convert to other OS but less flexible,
no library can be attached


Prefixs

#DATA 33    		| define data, 32 bit signed inter
:CODE dup * ;       | define word

DATA	| push 33 in data stack
'DATA	| push DATA address in stack
CODE	| execute CODE
'CODE	| push CODE address in stack
"this is a string"	| push address (in data memory) of this bytes
%ff %101 	| Hexa an binary numbers
^include.r3	| recursive include system (in esp32 is not recursive)
